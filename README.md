# Crowdfunding Back End
Maria Alistratova

## Planning:
### Concept/Name
The name of the project is **Generousource**

This project is a web platform that allows registered users to create fundraising initiatives for various causes and support other users’ initiatives through monetary donations. Donations can be made in any amount via bank transfer or PayPal.

### Intended Audience/User Stories
##### Intended Audience
The platform is intended for individuals who wish to raise funds for personal, social, or community causes, as well as for users who want to contribute financially to initiatives created by others.
The platform can be integrated into a company’s internal processes to allow employees to create fundraising initiatives for their needs.

- As a visitor, I want to browse existing fundraising initiatives so that I can decide whether I want to register on the platform and support a cause.
- As a visitor, I want to register on the website so that I can donate to existing initiatives or create my own fundraiser.
- As a user, I want to log in to the platform so that I can access features that require authentication.
- As a registered user, I want to create my own fundraising initiative so that I can raise funds for a cause I care about.
- As a registered user, I want to donate to other users’ initiatives so that I can support causes I believe in.
- As a registered user, I want to see whether I have already donated to an initiative so that I do not accidentally donate twice.
- As a fundraiser creator, I want to view donations made to my initiative so that I can track its progress.

### API Spec
{{ Fill out the table below to define your endpoints. An example of what this might look like is shown at the bottom of the page. 

It might look messy here in the PDF, but once it's rendered it looks very neat! 

It can be helpful to keep the markdown preview open in VS Code so that you can see what you're typing more easily. }}
